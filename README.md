# 4K Displaywall Bench

While most benchmarks are intended for the gaming industry, this simple app is for testing fillrate-bound applications such as those that need to drive high resolution displays, or many displays, or both.

#Building

##Linux

    cmake .

    make
    
##Windows

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" .

    cmake --build .

Use cmake flag -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to enable OpenGL debug output extension (4.3 and higher)


#Running

    ./4K_displaywall_bench -help

    ./4K_displaywall_bench -width 11520 -height 2160 -swap_interval 0

Use the width and height to define the viewport, which may span multiple displays.

If your driver does not support OpenGL 4.4 (GLXBadFBConfig), run with -gl 3 for a version 3.3 context.
